<h2><font color="blue">Tiled Text Files</font></h2>

<i>Before you start reading the deatils of the problem statement, you may want to look at the examples and at the public data
available at the bottom of the page to get an intuitive visual understanding of the task. The detailed description below
would be then easier to read and comprehend, hopefully.

<br><br>

The university team developing AI modules for the autonomous vehicles driving software is currently working on a problem
of text recognition in images captured by vehicle cameras.<br>
They are preparing a set of artificial images to test the modules.
Each image consists of a natural scene into which is pasted a
computer generated image of some text.  Before the text is renedered, it is stored in text files which
formatting reflects, to some degree, the appearance of the final rendering.
<br>

Each text is originally stored in a plain text file, called input file.
Then, the input file is converted to the so-called tiled file, which is later used as an input to the
image renderer.
<br><br>

The description of the tiled file and its contents is given below.
<br><br>

A <b>tiled file</b> is a regular text file, it differs from usual text files only by the arrangment of the text information stored in it.<br>

The text in the tiled text file, when printed with a non-proportional font, appears as printed on separate tiles.
Each <b>tile</b> consists of a tile header, a tile border and tile body.
<br><br>
The <b>tile header</b> is a rectangular area which contains information about the text in the tile body.
The header contains three lines of text, there is always one horizontal space between the header text and the header border.
The header contains the text:
<pre> Tile:   &lt;tileNumber&gt;
 Width:  &lt;widthValue&gt;
 Height: &lt;heightValue&gt;
</pre>
All three values <code>tileNumber</code>, <code>widthValue</code>, <code>heightValue</code>
 are integers and are all right aligned,
that is, their last characters share the same column in the tiled file. 
 The first character of the longest of these three values
is positioned in the text column 11, provided that the leftmost border 
of the tile header is positioned in the text column 1.<br>
The value <code>tileNumber</code> describes the number of the tile in 
the tiled file, the first tile has number 1, the next tile
has number 2 and so on. The number of tiles in the tiled file is the 
same as the number of file segments (see below) in the input file.<br>
The value <code>widthValue</code> describes the width of the interior of the tile body, it is equal to the length of the longest word in the
tile body.<br>
The value <code>heightValue</code> describes the height of the interior of the tile body, it is equal to the number of words in the
tile body.
<br><br>

The <b>tile body</b> is a rectangular area containing at least one word, each word occupies one line.
The part in the tile area where no character of any word appears is filled with spaces.
The area of the tile body is minimum possible.
<br><br>

The <b>tile border</b> is one character wide and it is printed around the tile header and around the tile body.
The corners of the tile header and the tile body are plus signs ( '+', ASCII 43).
The other symbols at the tile border are minus sign ( '-', ASCII 45) which are printed on the horizontal borders
and the vertical bar ( '|', ASCII 124 ) which are printed on the vertical borders. <br>
The bottom border of the tile header and the top border of the tile body  are printed on the same text line.
All four corners (two belonging to the bottom of the tile header border and two belonging to the top of the tile body border)
are printed on the common line, the remaining characters on that line are minus signs. If two corners
overlap they are printed with a single plus sign.
<br><br>

A <b>word</b> in an input file is a sequence of consecutive characters which does not contain any whitespace character.
Also, the first character of a word is either a first character in the text line
or it is immediately preceded by a whitespace character. Additionally,
the last character of each word is either the last character in the text line
or it is immediately followed by a whitespace character.

<br><br>

A <b>file segment</b> in an input file is a contiguous subsequence of words in the input file.
The length of the file segment is the number of the words it contains.
The lengths of words in a segment form a non-increasing sequence.
Note that file segment does not contain any whitespace characters.
An input file is <b>correctly segmented</b> if each word in the input file belongs to some
file segment and the number of file segments is minimum possible.
<br><br>

The text of the input file is stored in the tiled file as follows:
<ul>
<li>The input file is considered to be correctly segmented. Then, each file segment
is written in the interior of a tile body in the tiled file.<br>
</li><li>The order of file segments in the input file corresponds to the order of the tiles in the tiled file.<br>
</li><li>The first word in a file segment is printed at the bottom of its corresponding tile body interior,
the next word in the file segment is printed immediately above the first word and so on, the last word in the
file segment is printed above all previous words of the same file segment.<br>
</li><li>All words printed in a tile are aligned to the right border of the tile.<br>
</li><li>There is no blank line between two consecutive tiles.
</li></ul>



<h3><font color="blue">The task</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
Given an input text file  produce an output tiled file according to description above.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><font color="blue">Input</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
The input represents the contents of the input file.
Each line in the output corresponds to a line in the input file.
All characters in the input file are either printable ASCII characters or end-of-line characters
or tabulator characters.
Note that the input file may contain one or more consecutive empty lines.<br>
The size of the input file is less than 900 KB.


</p><h3><font color="blue">Output</font></h3>
<p align="justify">
The output contains the copy of the contents of the tiled file.
Each line in the output corresponds to a line in the tiled file.
